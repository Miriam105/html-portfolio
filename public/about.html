<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m 21 years old and currently a third-year student in IT. 
  What I enjoy most about my field is the way it allows me to combine logical thinking with creativity. I’ve always been passionate about design and visual arts, so I often explore graphic design and drawing in my free time. I also find inspiration in anime and Korean dramas, which influence the way I see storytelling, aesthetics, and even problem-solving from different perspectives.
  Music is another important part of my life, especially instrumental soundtracks.
  One of my favorite composers is Hans Zimmer, whose work motivates me to stay focused and inspired.</p>

<p>I come from a family with five sisters, and being the youngest has helped me develop a curious, playful, yet determined personality. It taught me to be adaptable, open-minded, and collaborative — qualities that I think are really valuable in both personal life and professional growth. My goal is to keep learning and developing my skills in IT, while also finding ways to connect technology with creativity, whether through design, innovative projects, or user-centered solutions.</p>
